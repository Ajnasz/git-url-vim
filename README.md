vim-github-urls
================

A vim plugin to create github urls.

Purpose
================

This allows you to add a hotkey that will create a github url for you to the branch, file, and line number of the file you're currently editing.  It puts this url on your clipboard for easy sharing.

Installation
================
I recommend pathogen:
```
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/tkjef/vim-github-urls
```

Use
================
Once installed you can use the default hotkey of `<leader>gl` when editing a file.  This creates a github url to the branch, file, and line and puts it on your clipboard. It will also be echoed for you to see.  

Feedback
================
Please feel free to give any and all feedback or pull requests.
